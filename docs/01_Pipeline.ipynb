    "The **QTc Formula Validation** module is a scientific verification utility within the Kepler-ECG pipeline. Its primary purpose is to rigorously assess the \"Heart Rate Independence\" of discovered mathematical formulas compared to traditional clinical standards (Bazett, Fridericia, Framingham, and Hodges). It evaluates how well a formula \"decouples\" the QT interval from the heart rate across diverse physiological ranges (Bradycardia, Normal, and Tachycardia). This script provides the statistical proof required to demonstrate that the new Kepler formulas offer superior stability and more accurate diagnostic thresholds for identifying patients at risk of Arrhythmia.\n",
